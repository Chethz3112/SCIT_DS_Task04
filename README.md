Traffic Accident Data Analysis

Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing traffic accident data to identify patterns related to time of day, weather conditions, and road conditions. It also visualizes accident hotspots to understand locations with a high number of accidents. The analysis helps in identifying major contributing factors to road accidents.

Objective
- Analyze traffic accident data
- Identify patterns based on time of day
- Study the effect of weather conditions on accidents
- Study the impact of road conditions
- Visualize accident hotspots
- Identify contributing factors to accidents

Dataset
Road Accident Dataset (Kaggle)

The dataset includes:
- State Name
- City Name
- Time of Day
- Weather Conditions
- Road Condition
- Accident Severity
- Number of Vehicles Involved
- Casualties and Fatalities

Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

Methodology
1. Loaded the traffic accident dataset using Pandas
2. Performed data exploration and cleaning
3. Removed missing values from important columns
4. Analyzed accidents based on time of day
5. Analyzed accidents based on weather conditions
6. Analyzed accidents based on road conditions
7. Visualized accident hotspots using city-wise analysis
8. Interpreted results to identify contributing factors

Visualizations
- Accidents by Time of Day
- Accidents by Weather Conditions
- Accidents by Road Condition
- Top Accident Hotspots by City

Results
- Accident frequency varies significantly based on time of day
- Adverse weather conditions increase accident occurrences
- Poor road conditions contribute to higher accident rates
- Certain cities are identified as major accident hotspots

Conclusion
The project successfully identifies important patterns and contributing factors in traffic accidents. The insights obtained from this analysis can help improve road safety, traffic planning, and accident prevention strategies.
